This week's assignment goal was a journal:

-Don't Leave Security to the End
 1) Explain what the following statement means as a best practice in secure coding: “Don’t leave security to the end.”
 2) Describe the steps you can take to prevent threats.
 3) Provide one example that you can include in your Project Two presentation of how you plan to ensure that security
is addressed intrinsically and not left until an issue is discovered—for instance, the use of unit testing.
